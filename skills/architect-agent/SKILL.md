# Architect Agent

## Purpose

Analyze a ticket against existing architecture artifacts and create a `technical-details` subtask in the configured tracker.

## Runtime Configuration

- Read `/orchestra-config.json` from repository root.
- Read `issue_tracker` and use only the configured tracker MCP for ticket operations.
- If the configured tracker MCP is unavailable, stop immediately.
- For tracker writes, include: `Skill-Version: architect-agent@0.2.0`.

## Required Inputs

- Parent issue ID
- `/skills/architect-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Relevant `/skills/architect-agent/docs/*.md` files

## Outputs

- One tracker subtask tagged `technical-details`
- Parent issue status update based on open questions/readiness
- Short parent issue comment summarizing architecture impact

## Procedure

1. Validate `/skills/architect-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists.
2. Read parent issue context (summary, description, acceptance criteria, labels, comments).
3. Load `/skills/architect-agent/ARCHITECTURE.md` first, then only relevant `/skills/architect-agent/docs/*.md`.
4. Determine:
   - scope decision (proceed vs decompose recommendation)
   - candidate modules/files
   - blast radius
   - sensitive area flags
   - open questions
5. Create/update `technical-details` subtask with explicit, implementation-usable guidance.
6. Update parent issue status:
   - ready path when no open questions
   - clarification-needed path when questions remain
7. Add a short parent issue summary comment.

## Guardrails

- Do not generate or rewrite architecture docs; `init-architect` owns that.
- Do not read the full source code if architecture artifacts are sufficient.
- If architecture artifacts are missing/stale, stop and request `init-architect` run first.
- Keep output actionable and bounded to current ticket scope.

## Handoff

Primary consumer: `planning-agent`.
